Linux is a popular and free operating system for desktop and laptop computers. It's an alternative to macOS or Windows, which can run right alongside them in a virtual machine. In this course, LinkedIn instructor Scott Simpson shows you how to install and make your way around the 22.04 release of Ubuntu Desktop Linux, one of the most user-friendly Linux distributions. Learn how to install Ubuntu on a virtual machine or directly on your computer to get started performing common tasks in the GNOME desktop environment: working with files, listening to music, editing photos, backing up your data, and sharing files with other users. If youâ€™re interested in more advanced topics, Scott gives a walk-through of how to interact with the command line, use the file system, and monitor resources. Whether you're considering switching from macOS or Windows, or your company is poised to migrate, join Scott to learn the skills you need to get up and running with Linux fast.
